                    Another day, another drop-off at daycare. As we wave our kids goodbye, we leave them hoping they’ll
                    be cared for. Acknowledged. Hugged.

                    Fortunately, we leave them in the hands of people whose entire lives are dedicated to doing just
                    that. There’s just one problem: Many institutions spend inordinate amounts of time on administrative
                    tasks, paperwork, repetition. Daily chores of updating, uploading, and downsizing the time they’d
                    love to spend with our kids. What if we had a solution that put care back in childcare?
