                <p>
                    You do the caring and build great institutions for the kids.
                    We help you focus on that by taking care of the formalities and paperwork, streamlining
                    admin routines, and by constantly keeping an eye on how to make your day
                    more about the caring, and less about the things taking your time away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Parentâ„¢ on your side, you get more quality time with the little ones in your care. In return,
                    they get happier parents when their daycare offers enriched education, real-time updates,
                    and streamlined communication that keeps everyone informed, happy, and trusting of your institution.
